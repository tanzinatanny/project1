    <p> Oh morning come bursting the clouds amen

    Lift off this blindfold let me see again <br>
  And bring back the water, let your ships roll in <br>
  In my heart she left a hole <br>
  
  The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties <br>
  The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes <br>
  And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes <br>
  And the saints go marching in <br>
  And sing <span class="pop"> slow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow </span> it down <br> </p>

  Lift off this blindfold let me see again <br>
  And bring back the water, let your ships roll in <br>
  In my heart she left a hole <br>
  
  The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties <br>
  The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes <br>
  And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes <br>
  And the saints go marching in <br>
  And sing slow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow it down <br> </p>
  
  <p>
  Through chaos as it swirls <br>
  It's us against the world <br>
  Like a river to a raindrop <br>
  I lost a friend My drunken hazard Daniel in a lion's den <br>
  And tonight I know it all has to begin again <br>
  So whatever you do, don't let go If we could float away <br> </p>
  
  <p>
  Fly up to the surface and just start again <br>
  Lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain <br>
  Just erodes us in the rain <br>
  Just erodes us and see roses in the rain, <br>
  Saying Slow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow it down <br>
  Slow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow it down <br> </p>
  
 <p>
  Through chaos as it swirls <br>
  It's us against the world <br>
  Through chaos as it swirls <br>
  It's us against the world <br>  
  </p>
